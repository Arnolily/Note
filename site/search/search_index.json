Mathematically:   Where  is the mapping function between input  and output . It would be easier to find such function if the input and output dataset follows the same distribution, and such mapping function would also be simpler, and simpler alleviate overfit problems.</p> <p>This is easy to understand: if your inputs follow distribution A and labels follow distribution B, then the mapping function would be uniquely A to B. This would cause generalization defect.</p> <ul> <li>Why not Standard Gaussian Distribution?</li> </ul> <p>Yes, there is a linear transformation (ie. scale and shift) after feature map  is normalized.</p> <p></p> <p>Let us explain this with an example.</p> <pre><code>net=nn.Sequential(\n    nn.Conv2d(),\n    nn.BatchNorm2d(),\n    nn.Sigmoid()\n)\n</code></pre> <p>In this net, we use a sigmoid activation function.</p> <p></p> <p>It is pretty clear that for , we have  . Which means the activation function is similar to an identity transformation. That is not a good sign, because the purpose of activation function is to add non-linearity in to the model. Therefore, without scale and shift, the non-linearity will be weak and the fitting process would be hard.</p> <p>ReLU, on the other hand, would not be heavily affected. So intuitionally speaking, it should be fine if we are using ReLU as activation function. But practically speaking, it seems better if we also let the model itself decide.</p>"},{"location":"index%20copy/","title":"My Daily Life and Thoughts on Science","text":"<p>Welcome to my blog!
