Basically, they are learning this map between input pattern and output pattern. However, due to ICS, the input pattern could be constantly changing, and such changes could break the learnt mapping function; therefore, ICS is believed to have detrimental effect on training process.</p> <p>I, however, would like to propose another understanding on ICS. In the traditional Machine learning, we assume that datas are IID (ie. independently and identically distributed).This is the foundation of Machine Learning, and the prerequisite of MLE (ie. Maximum Likelihood Estimation), which is the original form of all Loss functions. By exploiting BN, we surely guarantee the second I in IID, which is identically distributed. This could bring better generalizaiton performances to the network.</p> <p>However, other researchers had shown that ICS will not effect performance and BN does not reduce ICS. They prefer to explain the effectiveness of BN in another way.</p>"},{"location":"Resnet%20%26%20Batch%20Norms/#smoother-loss-landscape-2","title":"Smoother Loss landscape [2]","text":"<p>These researchers shown that BN contributes to the smoother Loss landscape, which could be visualized: </p> <p>With BN, the Loss landscape is smoother, training efficiency will be improved, and that is why higher learning rate could be utilized. </p>"},{"location":"Resnet%20%26%20Batch%20Norms/#better-use-of-non-linearity-3","title":"Better use of non-linearity [3]","text":"<p>Please be noted, there is a linear transformation (ie. scale and shift) after feature map  is normalized.</p> <p></p> <p>Let us suppose we use sigmoid function as activation function.</p> <p></p> <p>It is pretty clear that for , we have  . Which means the activation function is similar to an identity transformation. That is not a good sign, because the purpose of activation function is to add non-linearity in to the model. Therefore, without scale and shift, the non-linearity will be weak and the fitting process would be hard.</p> <p>Even for ReLU, which seems not going to be heavily effected, also witnessed the situation where all the neurons are either activated  or deactivated . Be aware that if a ReLU neuron is always active, then it is linear; if it is always deactive, then it does not exist.</p> <p>But in my perspective, this might not be the most important contribution of BN. Experiments have proved that if we put BN after activation, network could even sometimes outperform!</p>"},{"location":"Resnet%20%26%20Batch%20Norms/#possible-advantages-of-skip-connection","title":"Possible advantages of Skip-connection","text":""},{"location":"Resnet%20%26%20Batch%20Norms/#smoother-gradient-flow","title":"Smoother gradient flow","text":"<p>This is pointed out in [4], which is written by the Resnet author He, that one benifit of Skip-connection is smoother gradient flow.

The original insight was: if a deeper model perform worse than shallower model on test-set, it means that the extra layers of the deeper model failed to achieve identity mapping. Because if the extra layers are identity mapping, then the deeper model are the same with the shallower model.</p> <p>With this insight, he designed this skip-connection, which is basicly a manually added identity mapping.</p> <p>Now the real problem is, what caused such network degradation? Is the degradation problem really because of the failure of achieving indentity mapping?
