Essentially, layers are learning this map between input patterns and output patterns. However, due to ICS, the input pattern could constantly change, which might disrupt the learned mapping function. Therefore, ICS is believed to have a detrimental effect on the training process.</p> <p>However, I propose an alternative understanding of ICS. In traditional machine learning, we assume that data are IID (i.e., independently and identically distributed). This is the foundation of machine learning and the prerequisite of MLE (i.e., Maximum Likelihood Estimation), which is the original form of all loss functions. By using BN, we can ensure the second I in IID, which is identically distributed. This could lead to better generalization performance for the network.</p> <p>Other researchers, however, have shown that ICS does not affect performance and that BN does not reduce ICS. They prefer to explain BN\u2019s effectiveness differently.</p>"},{"location":"Resnet%20%26%20Batch%20Norms/#smoother-loss-landscape-2","title":"Smoother Loss Landscape [2]","text":"<p>These researchers demonstrated that BN contributes to a smoother loss landscape, which can be visualized:</p> <p></p> <p>With BN, the loss landscape is smoother, which improves training efficiency and allows for a higher learning rate.</p>"},{"location":"Resnet%20%26%20Batch%20Norms/#better-use-of-non-linearity-3","title":"Better Use of Non-linearity [3]","text":"<p>Note that there is a linear transformation (i.e., scaling and shifting) applied after the feature map  is normalized.</p> <p></p> <p>Suppose we use the sigmoid function as the activation function.</p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s clear that for , we have . This means the activation function acts almost as an identity transformation, which is not ideal because the purpose of an activation function is to add non-linearity to the model. Therefore, without scaling and shifting, the non-linearity would be weak, making the fitting process difficult.</p> <p>Even for ReLU, which seems less affected, there are cases where all neurons are either activated  or deactivated . If a ReLU neuron is always active, then it is linear; if it\u2019s always inactive, it doesn\u2019t contribute to the network.</p> <p>From my perspective, however, this might not be BN\u2019s most important contribution.

If those extra layers simply acted as identity mappings, the deeper model would match the performance of the shallower model.</p> <p>With this insight, he designed skip-connections, which are essentially manually added identity mappings.</p> <p>The real question is, what causes network degradation? Is the degradation problem truly due to a failure to achieve identity mapping?

[2] proposed a new explanation for network degradation. They first suggested that ResNet alleviates the shattered gradient problem. The shattered gradient problem is defined as follows:</p> <p>Shattered gradients undermine the effectiveness of algorithms that assume gradients at nearby points are similar, such as momentum-based and accelerated methods.</p> <p>Under this assumption, they quantified the shattered gradient problem as the autocorrelation function (ACF). A higher ACF leads to higher performance and a reduced shattered gradient problem. They demonstrated, through both mathematical proofs and experiments, that skip connections enhance ACF. However, their proof relied on very strong assumptions and was not entirely convincing to me.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Resnet%20%26%20Batch%20Norms/#citation","title":"Citation","text":"<p>[1] Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift.
